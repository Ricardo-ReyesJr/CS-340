Client/Server Development

*Project Notes**
In the process of creating a client / server application with CRUD and to be able to make it maintainable, readable, and adaptable. We have to create a software that easily be transferred and modular. Working modularly speeds up the production in the creation of the application. This also makes it easier to troubleshoot and find problems. Breaking down the problems as they show, allows me to analyze each indivual section of the software and it allows me to correct the problems one at a time. For this project working modular allowed me to be able to have small chunks and sections of the complete project. Computer scinece is part of STEM and I see it fittng since science, technology, engineering, and mathematics is all fields that require problem solving. We are here to solve a problem. With the Grazioso Salvare application we are solving the problem to their rescue dog program. How to make it earier to categorize and how to easily find the right dog for that rescue.

About the Project/Project Title
The purpose of this application is to allow an admin user to access the CRUD database with animal shelter data.

Motivation
This is in the development stage of a full stack application and to better understand the CRUD process.

Getting Started
To get started…
•	Enter the terminal import the aac_shelter_outcomes.csv 
•	Enter the MongoDB shell and create an index
•	After creating the index as well as a complex index create a user and password for authentication purposes.
•	Next, create the .py file and the run program with jupyter notebook.

Installation
The tools that you are required would be the latest Python installed to run the .py file and the .ipynb file
You will also need MongoDB, Mongo Shell, and the Mongo Tools installed to access the Mongo Database.

Usage
Use this space to show useful examples of how your project works and how it can be used. Be sure to include examples of your code, tests, and screenshots.

Code Example
Show what the library does as concisely as possible. Developers should be able to figure out how your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure that your code is short and concise.

Tests
The following are screenshots of the steps and code that is required to run the database.
