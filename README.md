Client/Server Development

In the process of creating a client / server application with CRUD and to be able to make it maintainable, readable, and adaptable. We have to create a software that easily be transferred and modular. Working modularly speeds up the production in the creation of the application. This also makes it easier to troubleshoot and find problems. Breaking down the problems as they show, allows me to analyze each indivual section of the software and it allows me to correct the problems one at a time. For this project working modular allowed me to be able to have small chunks and sections of the complete project. Computer scinece is part of STEM and I see it fittng since science, technology, engineering, and mathematics is all fields that require problem solving. We are here to solve a problem. With the Grazioso Salvare application we are solving the problem to their rescue dog program. How to make it earier to categorize and how to easily find the right dog for that rescue.
